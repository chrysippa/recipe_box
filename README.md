# Recipe Box
A collection of recipes from across the web, mainly for my personal use.

# Project Status
This project is in the beginning stages - adding basic functionality and structure.

I plan to get the Box up and running on GitHub Pages. Functionality will include:
For the collection:
- Add a recipe
- Add a category
- Browse recipes by category

For each recipe:
- View name, ingredients, and directions with ingredient amounts
- View a link to the original source, any of my own notes, and whether the recipe is untried
- Edit the recipe
- Delete the recipe
- Move recipe to a new category
